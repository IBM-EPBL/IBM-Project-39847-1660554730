## Fertilizers Recommendation System For Disease Prediction - Problem Statement. 
 
1. A Web Application Based On Artificial Intelligence For Crop Disease Detection And Fertilizer Recommendation.

2. Using Artificial Intelligence For Farmer,Crop Disease Detection, Fertilizer Recommendation, Pest Recognition And Proper Guideline.

3. Predicting Efficient Fertilizer Recommendation Based On Soil Features And Environmental Parameter Using AI.

4. The Project Has Been Proposed To Analyze Available Datasets And To Predict Fertilizer Requirements For Two Different Crops Based On Soil Features And Environmental Parameters Using Appropriate Machine Learning Models.

5. Farmers Do Not Have Enough Of Knowledge About Soil Nutrients Contents Such As Nitrogen, Phosphorous And Potassium In The Land.

6. A Fertilizer Requirement Prediction Model Would Be Very Useful For Obtaining Higher Yield Of Different Crops.

7. Design and Implementation of Fertilizer Recommendation System for Farmers

8. A nutrient recommendation system for soil fertilization based on AI.

9. Develop web-based solution for Cotton Crop health monitoring and suggest remedial actions. 

10. Develop smart & affordable solution to protect crops from wild animals.
